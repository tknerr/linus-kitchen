Improvements:

* various minor improvements when provisioning via Vagrant (see [PR #39](https://github.com/tknerr/linus-kitchen/pull/39)):
  * use all available CPU cores when starting the VM via vagrant
  * force colored output when provisioning the VM without a tty
  * adjust chef-zero log level when provisioning the VM without a tty
* noticeably improve chef-zero startup time by disabling the vmware ohai plugin (see [PR #40](https://github.com/tknerr/linus-kitchen/pull/40))
* add `--provision-only` flag to the `update-vm.sh` script (see [PR #42](https://github.com/tknerr/linus-kitchen/pull/42), [PR #47](https://github.com/tknerr/linus-kitchen/pull/47))

* place a README on the Desktop for better guiding the user (see [PR #56](https://github.com/tknerr/linus-kitchen/pull/56))

Breaking changes:

* the VM is now provisioned under a dedicated user account 'user', and thus the 'vagrant' user account can now be removed before packaging the box (see [PR #44](https://github.com/tknerr/linus-kitchen/pull/44))
